Overview

This project involves conducting an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank's telemarketing campaign dataset. The goal is to identify patterns and extract insights that could help improve the 

positive response rate for future campaigns. Various analytical techniques, such as descriptive statistics, univariate and bivariate analysis, and categorical variable analysis, were employed to assess the 

correlation between the target variable (positive response) and independent variables.

Objective

The main objective of this project is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the bank's telemarketing campaign data to identify patterns and insights that can enhance the positive response rate of future campaigns.


Data Source

Dataset: The dataset contains information about previous telemarketing campaigns run by the bank, including customer demographics, campaign details, and whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.

Data Attributes: Includes features such as customer age, job type, marital status, previous campaign outcomes, and the final result (whether the customer subscribed).

Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook (Python): For performing EDA and statistical analysis.

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

MS PowerPoint: To present the findings and insights from the analysis.

Analysis Process

Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and correcting data types.

Descriptive Statistics:

Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution of key variables.

Univariate Analysis:

Analyzed individual features such as age, balance, and duration of the calls to understand their distributions.

Bivariate Analysis:

Explored relationships between the target variable (positive response) and independent variables such as age, marital status, and previous campaign outcomes.

Categorical Variable Analysis:

Investigated the relationship between categorical variables (e.g., job type, marital status) and the campaign outcome.

Correlation Analysis:

Examined correlations between features and the likelihood of a customer responding positively to the campaign.

Key Insights

Age Group Influence: Middle-aged individuals were more likely to respond positively to the campaign compared to younger and older groups.

Job Type Impact: Customers in certain professions (e.g., management, blue-collar) had higher response rates, while students and unemployed individuals had lower responses.

Call Duration: Longer call durations were associated with higher chances of a successful outcome, indicating the importance of sustained engagement.

Previous Campaign Success: Customers who had responded positively to previous campaigns were more likely to subscribe again, showing the importance of past interactions.
